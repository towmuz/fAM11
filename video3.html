	   <p align="left"><I>An anecdote about Ms Annamma Chandy told by Dr Jolly Michael and written by Mrs Mini Daniel.</I>
	   <BR><BR>

Annacha was a good orator and a great motivational speaker right from her college days at TVM Women's College. She was a person who was not interested in fashion or jewellery. Her simple living and high thinking influenced many. When Jolly'ma got admission in Tvm Womens College, she needed admission in the Women's Hostel too connected to it. It was difficult to get hostel admission as only 40 persons could be accommodated from the whole of Kerala. Annacha took Jolly'ma to meet the Principal who was also the Warden of the hostel for admission. The Principal at once recognized Annacha from her college days as she was a lecturer when Annacha was studying there. She asked her whether she was still giving speeches etc and gave the admission at once. Jolly'ma and Chell'ma were mentored and cared for by Annacha more than their own parents. Jolly'ma says she preferred staying with Annacha even during holidays rather than go to be with Appachen/Ammachy. Once Chella'ma had to be taken for her leg operation to Neyuvoor Mission Hospital. Annacha accompanied with Ammachy/Appachen took Chella'ma to Neyivoor. The operation was done by an English missionary surgeon known as Somerville. They had to stay there for more than 2 weeks after the operation. In the meantime Dr. Somerville and his wife became great friends with Annacha as they could converse fluently with Annacha  in English. During their stay Annacha even taught Mrs Sonerville how to do tatting. Instead of sending letters to show her appreciation or gratitude to people who had helped she would pen beautiful poems and send it to them. Her grasp of the English language was exemplary. She was selected as a representative of YWCA and was sent to Delhi where she got the honour of meeting with Mrs Kamala Nehru and Indira Gandhi. She was an headmistress of a school . Later she became the inspector for several schools and had to frequently inspect them and devised several ways to improve the education system. A woman of high principles, always endeavoured to bring about the upliftment of women.
